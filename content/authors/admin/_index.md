## Welcome to Zerui Cheng's homepage~

I'm a second-year Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Pramod Viswanath](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/pramod-viswanath) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/). I received B.Eng. in Computer Science from [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) at [Tsinghua University](https://tsinghua.edu/) with the honor [Yao Award](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/list-673-1.html) and Yao Class summa cum laude. My research focuses on **decentralized and community-driven AI**. I employ interdisciplinary methodologies to **ensure transparency, fairness, and traceability across the entire AI lifecycle.** The ultimate goal is to establish an idealistic ecosystem where everyone can contribute to AI development, with each contribution recognized and rewarded equitably. My research is grounded in a [first-principle approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle). <br/>

During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working closely with [Prof. Zhixuan Fang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~fang/index.html). In 2022, I was grateful to have the chance to improve my research skills as an intern with [Prof. Fan Zhang](https://www.fanzhang.me/)'s group at Duke University and [Prof. Dawn Song](https://dawnsong.io/)'s group at the University of California, Berkeley.

  **Below are some highlighted projects to which I contribute. More exciting new works are under way — stay tuned! 
  
* **[OML](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03887)**: OML (Open, Monetizable, Loyal AI) model deployment scheme towards the vision of community-built AI. It is the whitepaper of [Sentient](https://sentient.xyz), a startup that has recently [raised an $85 million seed round](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/07/02/peter-thiels-founders-fund-leads-85m-seed-investment-into-open-source-ai-platform-sentient/);
* **[zkBridge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.00264)**: Cross-chain bridges with zero-knowledge proofs (Published in [ACM CCS 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3548606.3560652)). It is the whitepaper of Polyhedra Network, which [has a valuation of over $1 billion](https://www.theblock.co/post/282461/polyhedra-network-zkbridge-funding-1-billion-valuation-token-round);
* **[SAKSHI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16562)**: A paradigm for decentralized AI platforms via PoI (Proof-of-Inference);
* **[PoCW](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06669)**: How to use AI training/inference computation as PoW in blockchains.
  <br/>

  Besides,

* I'm an experienced competitive programmer with notable achievements in OI/ICPC contests (both as contestant and problem setter).
* I served as the president of Yao Class Students' Congress in 2022-2023.
* I was a participant of the TV show "Super Brain" (最强大脑 in Chinese) in 2023.
