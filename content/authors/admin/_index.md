## Welcome! I'm Zerui Cheng (Á®ãÊ≥ΩÁëû)

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) advised by [Prof. Pramod Viswanath](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/pramod-viswanath), and a part-time student researcher at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/) working on LLMs and code generation. I graduated from the prestigious [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) at Tsinghua University with the highest honors: **[Yao Award](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/list-673-1.html)** (top 10% of class) and **summa cum laude**.

My research lies at the intersection of **AI and blockchain systems**, focusing on building decentralized, transparent, and fair AI platforms. I'm passionate about ensuring AI development benefits the entire community through cryptographic guarantees and blockchain technology.
