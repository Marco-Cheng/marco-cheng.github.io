## Hi there, I'm Zerui Cheng (in Chinese：程泽瑞)~ Welcome~

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) advised by [Prof. Pramod Viswanath](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/pramod-viswanath), and will be a part-time student researcher at [ByteDance Seed Team](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/) starting Sep 2025. I obtained my B.Eng. in Computer Science from [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) at [Tsinghua University](https://tsinghua.edu/) with the honor [Yao Award](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/list-673-1.html) and Yao Class summa cum laude. `<br/>`

I do research in AI (evaluation and deployment) and blockchains, with the goal of bringing fairness and transparency with the power of technology, especially in the AI era today. I believe in research that has real-world impact, and my research has contributed to the whitepapers of the following startups: [Sentient](https://sentient.foundation/research), [Kite AI](https://gokite.ai/), and [PolyHedra](https://polyhedra.network/research/).

### Major Projects with Real-World Impact

* **[OML: Open, Monetizable, Loyal AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03887)** (AI deployment with blockchains)
  - Whitepaper for [Sentient](https://sentient.xyz), which raised [$85M seed funding](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/07/02/peter-thiels-founders-fund-leads-85m-seed-investment-into-open-source-ai-platform-sentient/)
  - **Featured at Citadel Securities PhD Summit 2025**
  - **Invited talk at University of Tübingen**
  - Pioneering AI-native cryptography for IP protection

* **[zkBridge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.00264)** (Cross-chain operations backed by cryptography, ACM CCS 2022)
  - Trustless cross-chain bridges using zero-knowledge proofs
  - Foundation of [Polyhedra Network](https://polyhedra.network/) (valued at [$1 billion](https://www.theblock.co/post/282461/polyhedra-network-zkbridge-funding-1-billion-valuation-token-round))

### Recent AI Benchmarking Contributions

* **[LiveCodeBench Pro](https://wenhaochai.com/livecodebenchpro/)** (2025) - Comprehensive code generation benchmark
* **[SPIN-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12349)** (COLM 2025) - Strategic planning & social reasoning for LLMs
* **[PeerBench](https://github.com/PeerBench)** (2025) - Academic peer review evaluation
* **[Humanity's Last Exam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14249)** (2025) - Ultimate test for AI capabilities

### Decentralized AI Platforms

* **[SAKSHI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16562)** - Proof-of-Inference for decentralized AI
* **[PoCW](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06669)** - AI computation as Proof-of-Work


Besides,

* I'm an experienced competitive programmer with notable achievements in OI/ICPC contests (both as contestant and problem setter).
* I served as the president of Yao Class Students' Congress in 2022-2023.
* I was a participant of the TV show "Super Brain" (最强大脑 in Chinese) in 2023.
