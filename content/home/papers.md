  * My research focuses on decentralized and community-driven AI. I employ interdisciplinary methodologies to ensure transparency, fairness, and traceability across the entire AI lifecycle, from data and GPU acquisition, training and inference, to fine-tuning, agentic frameworks, and evaluation. My goal is to establish an idealistic ecosystem where everyone can contribute to AI development, with each contribution recognized and rewarded equitably. This approach aims to overcome prevalent challenges such as monopolization, competitive arms races in data and GPUs, unreliable and noisy metrics, false claim and misinformation. My research is grounded in a first-principle approach. <br/>


  * Since sophomore year, I have been advised by [Prof. Zhixuan Fang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~fang/) to conduct scientific research on blockchain at Tsinghua University, and it's the initiation and enlightenment of my stepping into scientific research. During this period, I completed a research project: [Game Theoretical Analysis of Multiple Selfish Mining on Blockchains](https://www.zerui-cheng.com/project/game-theoretical-analysis-of-selfish-mining-in-blockchain/), and my first academic research paper: [Crowdsourcing Work as Mining: A Decentralized Computation and Storage Paradigm](https://www.zerui-cheng.com/papers/crowdsourcing-work-as-mining-a-decentralized-computing-paradigm/).<br/>

  * I was fortunate to be accepted as a research intern in the spring and summer of 2022, advised by [Prof. Fan Zhang](https://fanzhang.me) at Duke University and [Prof. Dawn Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I carried out research on two projects during the internship. One was the [design and analysis of side contracts against EIP-1559 in Ethereum](https://www.zerui-cheng.com/project/design-and-analysis-of-side-contracts-attacking-ethereum-eip-1559-from-theory-simulation-and-empirical-view/), and the other was the design and implementation of cross-chain bridge protocols (the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3548606.3560652) was accepted to ACM CCS 2022 and it's my first-ever publication).<br/>

  * I served as a reviewer for [IEEE JSAC Special Issue (Intelligent Blockchain)](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-jsac/cfp/intelligent-blockchain-future-communications-and-networking) in 2022 and [IEEE ToN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=90) in 2025.<br/>

  * The list of published papers and their details is attached below.<br/>
