* #### **COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING**

  * I am also an experienced and proud competitive programmer ([What is competitive programming?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)).

  * Onsite contests:  
  In high school, I was a two-time silver medalist of the Chinese National Olympiad in Informatics (both in 2017 and 2018). 
  During undergrad, representing Tsinghua University, I won a gold prize in ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) Yinchuan Regional, a silver prize in ICPC East Asia Continental Final of, and 2 gold prizes in CCPC (Chinese Collegiate Programming Contest). 
  For now, representing Princeton University, I won an overall third place and bronze medal in ICPC Greater New York Regional 2023 and advanced to ICPC North America Continental Championship 2024.

  * Online contests:
  I rank 16/182781 worldwide (and 2nd in China) on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) ([leaderboard here](https://www.hackerrank.com/leaderboard)).  
  I also compete on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) ([see my profile here](https://codeforces.com/profile/Marco_L_T)) and [CSAcademy](https://csacademy.com/) ([see my profile here](https://csacademy.com/user/Marco_L_T)).

  * Problem Setting:
  Besides, I'm also an experienced problem setter for competitive programming contests. 
  I have set and tested a number of problems for various contests.
  I'm the main author of [Codeforces Round #447](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/55858) ([problemset here](https://codeforces.com/contest/894)) 
  I'm also a problem setter of the Chinese National Olympiad in Informatics in 2021. Here is the problem I set ([original version in Chinese](https://uoj.ac/problem/676), [English translation](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/25068)). 

    

* #### **SOCIAL WORK**

  * I was gratefully elected and served as the president of Yao Class Students' Congress at Tsinghua University for 2022-23 academic year, and I was the vice president and deputy secretary the year before.

  * I'm a member of the Algorithm Association at Tsinghua University. And I served as the problem setter and coordinator of a number of contests (including National Olympiad in Informatics (2021), Tsinghua University Programming Contest (2020, 2021, 2022)).
