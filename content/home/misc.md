* #### **COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING**

  * I am also an experienced and proud competitive programmer ([What is competitive programming?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)).

  ###### * Onsite contests:  
  
    In high school, I was a two-time silver medalist of the Chinese National Olympiad in Informatics (both in 2017 and 2018). 
  
    During undergrad, representing Tsinghua University, I won a gold prize in ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) Regional, a silver prize in ICPC East Asia Continental Final, and 2 gold prizes in CCPC (Chinese Collegiate Programming Contest). 
  
    Now, representing Princeton University, I won an overall third place and bronze medal in ICPC Greater New York Regional 2023 and advanced to ICPC North America Continental Championship 2024.

  ######  * Online contests:
  
    I rank 16/182,781 worldwide (and 2nd in China) on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) ([leaderboard here](https://www.hackerrank.com/leaderboard)).  
  
    I also compete on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) ([see my profile here](https://codeforces.com/profile/Marco_L_T)) and [CSAcademy](https://csacademy.com/) ([see my profile here](https://csacademy.com/user/Marco_L_T)).

  ######  * Problem Setting:
  
    Besides, I'm also an experienced problem setter for competitive programming contests. 
  
    I have set and tested a number of problems for various contests.
  
    I'm the main author of [Codeforces Round #447](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/55858) ([problemset here](https://codeforces.com/contest/894)) 
  
    I'm also a problem setter of the Chinese National Olympiad in Informatics in 2021. Here is the problem I set ([original version in Chinese](https://uoj.ac/problem/676), [English translation](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/25068)). 

    
* #### **TV APPEARANCE**

* I was fortunate to be the participant of the well-known TV show "Super Brain" (最强大脑 in Chinese) in 2023. It's truly a fun and unforgettable experience.

* #### **SOCIAL WORK**

  * I was gratefully elected and served as the president of Yao Class Students' Congress at Tsinghua University for 2022-23 academic year, and I was the vice president and deputy secretary for 2021-22 academic year.

  * I'm a member of the Algorithm Association at Tsinghua University. And I served as the problem setter and coordinator of a number of contests (including National Olympiad in Informatics (2021), Tsinghua University Programming Contest (2020, 2021, 2022)).

  * I was a volunteer for the 110th anniversary of Tsinghua University.

    

* #### AVOCATION

  * Fan of NBA, Formula 1, and European Soccer. My favorite sporting stars include Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors, NBA), Lewis Hamilton (Ferrari, F1), Charles Leclerc (Ferrari, F1), and Marco Reus (LA Galaxy, previously BVB Dortmund).
