###### **[Oct 2025] (papers and acceptance notifications)**

Several papers that I contributed to are online now, and will be presented in different venues in the near future!

First-author papers:

- [Paper 1: PeerBench Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07575): We analyze the systematic challenges faced by AI benchmark paradigm today—data contamination, collusion, overfitting, etc, and propose PeerBench, a novel mechanism based on community contribution and reputation to reliably and efficiently measure data quality and build fair leaderboards. Our vision is to return AI evaluation to its role as a public good, aligning tech development with all humanity's needs, not just those of a few giants. [Aceepted to NeurIPS 2025]
- [Paper 2: OML Primitive](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03887v4): Are openness and commercial value mutually exclusive? In this paper, we go one step further than the original OML whitepaper of Sentient last year. We formalize the OML framework, exploring a path where models are open-access, but technical safeguards prevent misuse. OML offers a blueprint for sustainable, open AI governance and operation of next-gen AI. [Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Lock-LLM]

Co-first-author papers:

- [Paper 3: CAIA (Crypto AI Agent Benchmark)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00332): The first AI agent benchmark in crypto and web3. Our results show that models aren't yet reliable in this high-stakes, high-misinformation adversarial domain, and there is a giant gap to an ideal world where we can let AI reliably control users' wallets and manage real funds without risks. [Aceepted to ICAIF 2025 AI4F, AI-R2D2]
- [Paper 4: AutoCode](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12803):  The follow-up work to LiveCodeBench Pro crafted by [the LiveCodeBench Pro dream team](https://livecodebenchpro.com/). We create a robust and efficient AI system that auto-generates coding problems to solve the data scarcity bottleneck.

Co-author papers:

- [Paper 5: NAO (Nondeterminism-Aware Optimistic Verification for Floating-Point Neural Networks)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16028): A crucial step for Decentralized AI, ensuring that AI inference results are reproducible and verifiable, so that the rights of end users are protected. It solves the bottleneck that we encountered in our [Sakshi paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16562) 2 years ago, and is a critical step for realizing our vision of a decentralized AI platform.
- {{< staticref "uploads/Kite_whitepaper.pdf" "newtab" >}}Paper 6: Kite AI Whitepaper{{< /staticref >}}:  I co-authored the whitepaper for Kite AI as a research collaborator. Kite AI is building a native payment infrastructure for AI agents, and we depict the vision where agents transact autonomously with cryptographic accountability and traceability. Kite AI has raised $33 million from top–tier investors, including PayPal, General Catalyst, Coinbase Venture and leading blockchain foundations.

Among those, [PeerBench](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/loc/san-diego/poster/121919) and [LiveCodeBench Pro](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/loc/san-diego/poster/121627) will be presented at [NeurIPS 2025 Main Conference](https://neurips.cc/) in San Diego on Dec 3; [CAIA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00332) will be presented at [ICAIF 2025](https://icaif25.org/) in Singapore ([AI4F](https://ai4f.org/) on Nov 15, [AI-R2D2](https://ai-r2d2.github.io/) on Nov 16); and [OML Primitive](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/loc/san-diego/128604) will be presented at [NeurIPS 2025 Lock-LLM](https://lock-llm.github.io/) on Dec 6. Stay tuned for them!
